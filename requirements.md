<h3>2. General Description of Product</h3>

Our project will be a 2D top down role playing game, rpg for short.  We decided to use the unity engine. Now, If you’ve ever played the original legend of zelda, you already have an idea of what our game is 
going to look like. If you haven’t seen that game then just imagine a little sticker on your table that moves around. Like Legend of Zelda, our video game will be set in a high fantasy world. 
So if you’ve ever played dungeons and dragons or even skyrim, some of the elements in those games will be found in ours. For example, we’ll have dwarves and goblins. 
We’re going for a more lighthearted theme.
